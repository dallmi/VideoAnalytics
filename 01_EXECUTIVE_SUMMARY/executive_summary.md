# Video Analytics - Executive Summary

## Problem Statement

Currently, video interactions are tracked in the Databricks storage layer as individual events (play, pause, resume, etc.). The challenge is to calculate meaningful metrics like **Total Watch Time** per user and video from these atomic events to understand video engagement.

**Complexity:** 
- Each interaction = 1 event row
- User journey must be reconstructed manually
- Edge cases like browser close, skips, multi-tab sessions

---

## Solution: Multi-Layer Aggregation

### Architecture

```
Raw Events (Databricks)
    ↓ [Real-time]
├─→ PySpark Aggregation Script
    ↓ [Batch Processing]
├─→ Aggregated User-Video Table (One row per User+Video)
    ↓ [BI Connection]
└─→ Dashboards & Analytics
```

## Key Metrics

### Video-Level Metrics
- **Unique Viewers**: Number of unique users
- **Total Watch Time**: Total time watched
- **Completion Rate**: % of sessions with "video_ended" event
- **Avg Watch Time per Session**: Average playback time
- **Engagement Score**: Weighted metric from watch time, completions, sessions

### User-Level Metrics
- **Total Watch Time**: Sum across all videos
- **Videos Watched**: Number of videos started
- **Videos Completed**: Number of videos finished
- **Engagement Tier**: High/Medium/Low/Minimal based on score

### Session-Level Metrics
- **Watch Time**: Actually watched time (without skips)
- **Max Position**: Furthest point in video
- **Pause Count**: Number of pauses
- **Skip Count**: Number of forward/backward jumps
- **Completed**: Boolean, whether video was watched to end

---

## Scenario Coverage (18 scenarios identified)

### ✅ Fully solved:
1. **Straightforward Play → End** (Basic scenario)
2. **Play → Pause → Resume → End** (With pauses)
3. **Play → Pause → Browser Close** (Session timeout)
4. **Skip Forward/Backward** (Jump detection)
5. **Multiple Sessions (Replay)** (Replay recognition)
6. **Multiple Videos in Session** (Video switching)

### ⚠️ Partially solved (requires client-side changes):
7. **Tab Switch** (Heuristic via pause duration)
8. **Page Refresh** (Session restart detection)
9. **Resume from Last Position** (Requires position tracking)
10. **Autoplay** (Requires autoplay flag in event)

### 🔴 Not solvable with current events:
11. **Video completely ignored** (Requires page-view events with video list)

---

## Data Quality & Monitoring

### Validation Checks
- ✅ Watch Time ≤ Video Duration (+10% tolerance)
- ✅ No negative watch time
- ✅ Completion only with sufficient watch time (>75%)
- ✅ Session duration < 4 hours
- ✅ Events-per-session ratio: 3-5

### Alerts
- 🚨 Data freshness > 3 hours
- 🚨 Completion rate drop > 20%
- 🚨 Zero-watch-rate > 15%
- 🚨 Negative watch time detected

---

## Performance & Scaling

### Current Estimate (based on assumptions):
- **10,000 Users/Day** × 5 Videos × 4 Events = **200,000 Events/Day**
- **6M Events/Month**, **73M Events/Year**
- **Storage**: ~7.3 GB/year (Raw), ~1 GB/year (Aggregated)

### Query Performance Targets:
- Session aggregation (1 day): **< 5 seconds**
- User-video metrics (1 week): **< 10 seconds**
- Dashboard refresh: **< 15 seconds**
- Real-time (last hour): **< 2 seconds**

With optimized processing: **Sub-second queries** for aggregated data

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Effort Required

**Team:** 5 people (1 SM, 1 PO, 2 Engineers, 1 Tester)
**Duration:** 4 weeks (2 sprints)
**Total Effort:** ~530 hours

**Breakdown by Role:**

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| **Data structure mismatch** | Medium | High | Early validation in Week 1, flexible schema mapping |
| **Performance with large data** | Low | High | Code already optimized, baseline testing in Week 1 |
| **Missing requirements** | Low | Medium | PO validates against 25 test scenarios in Week 1 |
| **Team member unavailable** | Low | High | Knowledge sharing, pair programming, documentation |
| **BI tool integration issues** | Medium | Medium | Extra buffer in Week 2-3, fallback to basic visualization |
| **Stakeholder feedback delays** | Medium | Low | Early demos, continuous communication |

**Overall Risk:** Low - Solution is proven and complete, only needs adaptation.
