## üîç Key Documentation Examples

### Example 1: Watch Segment Calculation
**Location**: `databricks_video_aggregation.py:296-435`

**What You'll Find**:
```
ALGORITHM EXPLANATION:
1. Sort events by timestamp within each (userId, videoId, sessionId) group
2. Use window functions to look at previous event (lag function)
3. Calculate time differences...
[continues with full explanation]

EXAMPLE:
Input events:
timestamp            eventName      currentTime
2024-01-01 10:00:00  video_play     0.0
2024-01-01 10:00:30  video_pause    30.0
[continues with full example]

Output segments:
Row 2: prevEvent=play, event=pause, prevTime=0, currentTime=30
       ‚Üí timeDelta=30, isValidSegment=True, watchedSeconds=30
[continues showing calculations for each row]
```

---

### Example 2: Peter's Scenario
**Location**: Multiple files

**What You'll Find**:
- Raw events: 6 events with exact timestamps
- Watch segments: 3 segments calculated
- Total watch time: 130 seconds = 30s + 90s + 10s (shown step by step)
- Unique seconds: 120 seconds (explanation of why 110-120 is not double-counted)
- Percentages: watchPercentage = 130/300 * 100 = 43.3% (calculation shown)
- Business interpretation: "User watched 43.3% of video with one rewind"

---

### Example 3: Data Quality Flags
**Location**: `databricks_video_aggregation.py:410-417`

**What You'll Find**:
```python
# Data quality flags
enriched = enriched.withColumn(
    "dataQualityFlag",
    when(col("totalWatchTime") > col("videoDuration") * 1.2, "excessive_watch_time")
    .when(col("totalWatchTime") < 5, "very_short_watch")
    .when(col("completionCount") > 0 & (col("watchPercentage") < 75), "completed_without_sufficient_watch")
    .otherwise("ok")
)
```

With explanation:
- `excessive_watch_time`: Total watch > 120% of duration (data error)
- `very_short_watch`: Less than 5 seconds (not meaningful engagement)
- `completed_without_sufficient_watch`: Flagged as complete but didn't watch most of video
- `ok`: No data quality issues
