### Appendix D: Project Terminology

This project focuses specifically on **Click Tracking** - the systematic capture and analysis of user interactions (clicks and downloads) within the intranet environment. While this is a subset of broader "Intranet Analytics," the term "Click Tracking" more accurately describes the core functionality and data collection methodology employed by this system.
