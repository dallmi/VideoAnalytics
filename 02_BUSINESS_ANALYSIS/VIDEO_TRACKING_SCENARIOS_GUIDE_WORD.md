## 🎯 Purpose & Goal

### What Are We Trying to Achieve?

We want to **understand how users interact with our videos** by tracking their viewing behavior and calculating meaningful engagement metrics.

**Business Goal:** Answer questions like:
- How much of each video do users actually watch?
- Which videos keep users engaged?
- Where do users drop off?
- Are users rewatching content?

**Technical Goal:** Transform raw video events (play, pause, resume, end) into **one aggregated row per User+Video combination** with metrics like:
- Total watch time
- Completion percentage
- Engagement score
- Unique seconds watched

---

## 📊 The Big Picture

### Input vs Output

**INPUT: Raw Events (Many Rows)**

| timestamp           | userId | videoId    | eventName    | position | Action              |
|---------------------|--------|------------|--------------|----------|---------------------|
| 2024-01-15 10:00:00 | peter  | video_001  | video_play   | 0        | Started playing     |
| 2024-01-15 10:00:30 | peter  | video_001  | video_pause  | 30       | Watched 30s         |
| 2024-01-15 10:01:00 | peter  | video_001  | video_resume | 30       | Resumed after 30s   |
| 2024-01-15 10:02:30 | peter  | video_001  | video_pause  | 120      | Watched 90s more    |

**⬇ AGGREGATION PROCESS ⬇**

**OUTPUT: One Row Per User+Video**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| userId | peter |
| videoId | video_001 |
| totalWatchTime | 130 seconds |
| watchPercentage | 43.3% |
| completionPercentage | 40% |
| engagementScore | 58.5 |
| sessionCount | 1 |

## 🎬 Understanding Video Events

### The Four Event Types

Our system tracks **four types of video events**:

| Event | Symbol | Description | When It Fires |
|-------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **video_play** | ▶️ | User starts video | User clicks play button from stopped state |
| **video_pause** | ⏸️ | User pauses video | User clicks pause or video auto-pauses |
| **video_resume** | ▶️ | User resumes video | User clicks play after pausing |
| **video_ended** | ✅ | Video completed | Video reaches the end naturally |

### Event Data Structure

Each event contains:

| Field | Example | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| timestamp | 2024-01-15 10:00:00 | Real-world time |
| userId | peter | Who is watching |
| sessionId | session_001 | Browser session ID |
| videoId | video_001 | Which video |
| eventName | video_play | Event type |
| currentTime | 0.0 | Position in video (seconds) |

---

## 🔑 The Golden Rule: Event Pairs

### Why We Need BOTH Start and End Events

**THE MOST IMPORTANT CONCEPT:**

Watch time is ONLY counted between valid event PAIRS.

**✅ VALID PAIRS (We count these):**
- video_play → video_pause
- video_play → video_ended
- video_resume → video_pause
- video_resume → video_ended

**❌ INVALID (We DON'T count these):**
- video_play → [nothing] (browser closed)
- video_resume → [nothing] (browser closed)
- video_pause → video_resume (not watching)

**WHY?** Without both events, we cannot know how long the user actually watched. We use a CONSERVATIVE approach: only count what we KNOW for certain.

### Visual Example

**User watches video:**

**Segment 1:** ▶️ play(0s) ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━► ⏸️ pause(30s)
- **✅ COUNTED: 30s** (We have both events!)

**Segment 2:** ⏸️ pause(30s) ────────────────► ▶️ resume(30s)
- **❌ NOT COUNTED: 0s** (User not watching while paused)

**Segment 3:** ▶️ resume(30s) ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━► ❌ [browser closed]
- **❌ NOT COUNTED: 0s** (No closing event = can't calculate)

## 📋 All Tracking Scenarios

Let's walk through **every possible scenario** with examples showing raw input data and transformed output.

---

### **Scenario 1: Perfect Viewing - Start to Finish** ✅

**Description:** User plays video and watches until the end without interruption.

#### Raw Input Events:

#### Visual Timeline:

**Video (300s duration):**
- 0s ──────────► 60s [PAUSED] 60s ────────────────────► 300s

**Segments:**
- **Segment 1:** ▶️ play(0s) ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━► ⏸️ pause(60s) = **✅ 60s watched**
- **Segment 2:** ⏸️ pause(60s) ─ [5 min break] ─► ▶️ resume(60s) = **❌ 0s (not watching)**
- **Segment 3:** ▶️ resume(60s) ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━► ✅ ended(300s) = **✅ 240s watched**
- **Total:** 60s + 240s = 300s

|--------|-------|-------------|
| userId | bob | User identifier |
| videoId | video_001 | Video identifier |
| videoDuration | 300s | Video length |
| totalWatchTime | 300s | 60 + 240 = 300 |
| uniqueSecondsWatched | 300s | All unique |
| watchPercentage | 100% | Complete watch |
| completionPercentage | 100% | Reached end |
| sessionCount | 1 | Single session |
| pauseCount | 1 | Paused once |
| completed | true | Finished |
| engagementScore | 55.0 | Slightly lower due to pause |
| engagementTier | High | Still high engagement |

**Business Insight:** User completed video with one pause (bathroom break?). Still high engagement.

---

### **Scenario 3: Browser Close (Lost Session)** ❌

**Description:** User starts watching but closes browser without pausing. This is the **most common data loss scenario**.

#### Raw Input Events:

| timestamp           | userId | videoId    | eventName      | currentTime | Action                                                  |
|---------------------|--------|------------|----------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| 2024-01-15 10:00:00 | lisa   | video_001  | video_play     | 0           | Started playing from beginning                          |
| 2024-01-15 10:00:45 | lisa   | video_001  | video_pause    | 45          | Watched 45s, then paused                                |
| 2024-01-15 10:00:50 | lisa   | video_001  | video_resume   | 45          | Resumed after 5s                                        |
| [Browser closed - no more events - lost tracking of remaining watch time] | | | | |

#### Visual Timeline:

**Video (300s duration):**
- 0s ────► 45s [PAUSE] 45s ━━━━━━━━━━━━► [~unknown position, browser closed]

**Segments:**
- **Segment 1:** ▶️ play(0s) ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━► ⏸️ pause(45s) = **✅ 45s watched**
- **Segment 2:** ▶️ resume(45s) ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━► ❌ [browser close at ~75s?] = **❌ 0s counted** (No closing event!)
- **Total Counted:** 45s
- **Actually Watched:** ~75s (estimated)
- **Lost:** ~30s

#### Calculated Output:

| Metric | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| userId | lisa | User identifier |
| videoId | video_001 | Video identifier |
| videoDuration | 300s | Video length |
| totalWatchTime | 45s | **Only first segment counted!** |
| uniqueSecondsWatched | 45s | Appears low |
| watchPercentage | 15% | Based on tracked data |
| completionPercentage | 15% | Based on last known position (45s) |
| sessionCount | 1 | Single session |
| pauseCount | 1 | One pause |
| completed | false | Did not finish |
| completionCount | 0 | No completion |
| engagementScore | 5.25 | Very low (lost data) |
| engagementTier | Minimal | Appears minimal |

**Business Insight:** This looks like low engagement, but in reality, we **lost tracking data** when the user closed their browser. This is why closing events matter!

**What Actually Happened:** User probably watched for ~75 seconds but we can only count the first 45 seconds.

**How to Fix:** Implement heartbeat events (send position every 30s) or browser close detection.

| 2024-01-15 10:00:30 | tom    | video_002  | video_pause    | 30          | Watched 30s, then paused            |
| 2024-01-15 10:00:32 | tom    | video_002  | video_resume   | 300         | Skipped forward 270s (4.5min)       |
| 2024-01-15 10:01:32 | tom    | video_002  | video_ended    | 360         | Watched 60s more, completed         |

#### Visual Timeline:

**Video (600s duration):**
- 0s ──► 30s [SKIP ⏩] 300s ──────────────► 360s

**Segments:**
- **Segment 1:** ▶️ play(0s) ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━► ⏸️ pause(30s) = **✅ 30s watched**
- **Segment 2:** ⏸️ pause(30s) ─ [instant] ─► ▶️ resume(300s) = **⚠️ Forward jump detected: 270s** (User skipped 4.5 minutes)
- **Segment 3:** ▶️ resume(300s) ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━► ✅ ended(360s) = **✅ 60s watched**
- **Total Watched:** 30 + 60 = 90s
- **Skipped Content:** 270s not watched

#### Calculated Output:

| Metric | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|

**Combined:**
- Session 1: 60s watched
- Session 2: 180s watched
- Total: 240s
- Unique: 180s (0-180s, counting each second only once)

#### Calculated Output:

| Metric | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| userId | sarah | User identifier |
| videoId | video_003 | Video identifier |
| videoDuration | 180s | Video length |
| **totalWatchTime** | 240s | 60 + 180 = 240s total (aggregated across BOTH sessions) |

| avgWatchTimePerSession | 120s | 240/2 = 120s per session |
| engagementScore | 114.0 | Very high (multiple sessions + completion) |
| engagementTier | High | High engagement |

**Business Insight:** User came back the next day to finish the video. Shows strong interest. Common in:
- Training materials (watch partially, apply, come back)
- Complex topics (need multiple viewings)
- Reference videos (watch when needed)

---

### **Scenario 7: Multi-Video Session (Binge Watching)** 📺

**Description:** User watches multiple videos in one session.

#### Raw Input Events:

| timestamp           | userId | sessionId  | videoId    | eventName    | currentTime | Action                          |
|---------------------|--------|------------|------------|--------------|-------------|---------------------------------|
| 2024-01-15 10:00:00 | max    | session_1  | video_001  | video_play   | 0           | Started video_001               |
| 2024-01-15 10:05:00 | max    | session_1  | video_001  | video_ended  | 300         | Watched 300s, completed video_001 |
| 2024-01-15 10:05:10 | max    | session_1  | video_002  | video_play   | 0           | Started video_002 (10s later)   |
| 2024-01-15 10:10:10 | max    | session_1  | video_002  | video_ended  | 300         | Watched 300s, completed video_002 |
| 2024-01-15 10:10:20 | max    | session_1  | video_003  | video_play   | 0           | Started video_003 (10s later)   |
| 2024-01-15 10:13:20 | max    | session_1  | video_003  | video_ended  | 180         | Watched 180s, completed video_003 |

#### How Data is Aggregated:

**System creates THREE separate output rows (one per User+Video):**

| Row | User + Video | totalWatchTime | watchPercentage | sessionCount |
|-----|-------------|----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Row 1 | max + video_001 | 300s | 100% | 1 |
| Row 2 | max + video_002 | 300s | 100% | 1 |
| Row 3 | max + video_003 | 180s | 100% | 1 |

#### Calculated Output (Example for Video 001):

| Metric | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| userId | max | User identifier |
| videoId | video_001 | Video identifier |
| videoDuration | 300s | Video length |
| totalWatchTime | 300s | Full watch |
| watchPercentage | 100% | Complete |
| completionPercentage | 100% | Finished |
| sessionCount | 1 | Single session |
| completed | true | Completed |
| engagementScore | 60.0 | High |
| engagementTier | High | High engagement |

**Business Insight:** User is highly engaged and consuming multiple pieces of content. Perfect for:
- Analyzing user journey (which videos watched in sequence)
- Course progression tracking
- Content recommendations (video_002 follows video_001)

**Note:** Each user+video combination gets its own row. To analyze the full session, query all videos with `sessionId = "session_1"`.

---

### **Scenario 8: Abandoned Early (Low Engagement)** 😞

**Description:** User starts video but loses interest quickly.

#### Raw Input Events:

| timestamp           | userId | videoId    | eventName      | currentTime | Action                          |
|---------------------|--------|------------|----------------|-------------|---------------------------------|
| 2024-01-15 10:00:00 | john   | video_001  | video_play     | 0           | Started playing from beginning  |
| 2024-01-15 10:00:08 | john   | video_001  | video_pause    | 8           | Watched only 8s, abandoned      |

#### Visual Timeline:

**Video (300s duration):**
- 0s ──────► 8s [ABANDONED] (292s unwatched)
- **✅ 8s watched**
- User watched only 8 seconds (2.7%) then left.

#### Calculated Output:

| Metric | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| userId | john | User identifier |
| videoId | video_001 | Video identifier |

#### Visual Timeline:

**Video (600s = 10 min duration):**
- 0s ──► 60s [P] 60s ──────► 180s [P] 300s ──► 360s [P] 200s ───────────────► 600s
- Segments: 60s + 120s + [skip] + 60s + [rewind] + 400s

**Segments:**
- **1️⃣** 0→60: 60s ✅
- **2️⃣** 60→180: 120s ✅
- **3️⃣** 300→360: 60s ✅
- **4️⃣** 200→600: 400s ✅
- **Total:** 640s watched
- **Unique:** 0-180, 200-600 = 580s unique (0-180=180s, 200-600=400s)

#### Calculated Output:

| Metric | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| userId | alex | User identifier |
| videoId | video_002 | Video identifier |
| videoDuration | 600s | Video length |

| uniqueWatchPercentage | 96.7% | Almost all unique seconds |
| sessionCount | 1 | Single session |
| maxPositionReached | 600s | Reached end |
| completed | true | Completed |
| pauseCount | 4 | Many pauses |
| forwardSkipCount | 1 | Skip forward (180→300) |
| backwardSkipCount | 1 | Skip back (360→200) |
| avgPausesPerSession | 4.0 | High interaction |
| navigationComplexity | high | Custom flag |
| engagementScore | 65.7 | High score |
| engagementTier | High | High despite complexity |

**Business Insight:** User is highly engaged but navigating actively. Possible reasons:
- Technical/educational content (pausing to practice)
- Note-taking behavior
- Looking for specific information
- Following along with hands-on tutorial

**Action Items:** This is actually **positive engagement** - don't penalize it!

---

### **Scenario 10: Skip to End (Completion Gaming)** 🎮

**Description:** User skips directly to end to mark video as "watched" without actually watching.

#### Raw Input Events:

| timestamp           | userId | videoId    | eventName      | currentTime | Action                              |
|---------------------|--------|------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| 2024-01-15 10:00:00 | mike   | video_001  | video_play     | 0           | Started playing from beginning      |
| 2024-01-15 10:00:05 | mike   | video_001  | video_pause    | 5           | Watched only 5s, paused             |
| 2024-01-15 10:00:06 | mike   | video_001  | video_resume   | 295         | Skipped forward 290s to near end    |
| 2024-01-15 10:00:11 | mike   | video_001  | video_ended    | 300         | Watched last 5s, gaming system      |

#### Visual Timeline:

**Video (300s duration):**
- 0s ─► 5s [SKIP ⏩ 290s] 295s ───► 300s
- Segments: 5s + 5s
- **Watched:** Only 10 seconds out of 300
- **Skipped:** 290 seconds (97%)
- **Completed:** YES (technically)

#### Calculated Output:

| Metric | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| userId | mike | User identifier |
| videoId | video_001 | Video identifier |
| videoDuration | 300s | Video length |
| totalWatchTime | 10s | Very low |
| uniqueSecondsWatched | 10s | Minimal |
| watchPercentage | 3.3% | Almost nothing |
| completionPercentage | 100% | But marked complete! |
| uniqueWatchPercentage | 3.3% | Very low |
| sessionCount | 1 | Single session |
| completed | true | Video ended |
| completionCount | 1 | Technically completed |
| forwardSkipCount | 1 | One skip |
| skipAmount | 290s | Large skip |
| engagementScore | 50.2 | Medium due to completion bonus |
| engagementTier | Medium | Inflated by completion |
| dataQualityFlag | completed_without_sufficient_watch | ⚠️ RED FLAG |

**Business Insight:** User "gamed" the completion metric by skipping to the end. This is **fake engagement**.

**Detection:** Flag raised because:
- `completed = true` BUT `watchPercentage < 75%`

**Action Items:**
- Filter out these records from "completion rate" KPIs
- Require minimum watch percentage for completion credit
- Analyze if certification/credit is being gamed

## 📈 Key Metrics Explained

### Metric Definitions & Formulas

| Metric | Formula | What It Measures | Good Value |
|--------|---------|------------------|------------|
| **totalWatchTime** | Sum of all valid watch segments | Total time spent watching (includes replays) | Higher = more engaged |
| **uniqueSecondsWatched** | Count of unique seconds covered | Actual video coverage without duplicates | Higher = more content seen |
| **watchPercentage** | (totalWatchTime / videoDuration) × 100 | How much time invested (can exceed 100%) | >75% = engaged |
| **completionPercentage** | (maxPositionReached / videoDuration) × 100 | How far into video user got | 100% = finished |
| **maxPositionReached** | MAX(currentTime) across all events | Furthest point in video | = videoDuration is best |
| **sessionCount** | COUNT(DISTINCT sessionId) | Number of viewing sessions | >1 = replay behavior |
| **engagementScore** | (watchTime/60) + (completions × 50) + (sessions × 5) - (skips × 2) | Overall engagement quality | >50 = good |

### Example Comparison

| Metric | User A (Best) | User B (Good) | User C (Gaming) |
|--------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| totalWatchTime | 300s | 280s | 10s |
| uniqueSeconds | 300s | 280s | 10s |
| watchPct | 100% | 93% | 3% |
| completionPct | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| completed | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| engagementScore | 60 | 59 | 50 |
| dataQualityFlag | ok | ok | ⚠️ FLAG |

**Analysis:**
- **User A:** Perfect viewing
- **User B:** Watched most, then skipped to end (acceptable)
- **User C:** Gaming the system (skipped almost everything)

## 🔍 Data Quality & Edge Cases

### Quality Flags

The system automatically detects problematic data:

| Flag | Condition | What It Means |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| `ok` | Normal viewing pattern | Data looks good ✅ |
| `excessive_watch_time` | watchPercentage > 120% | Possible data quality issue or heavy replay |
| `very_short_watch` | totalWatchTime < 5s | User abandoned immediately |
| `completed_without_sufficient_watch` | completed = true AND watchPercentage < 75% | Gaming/skipping to end |
| `negative_watch_time` | Calculated time < 0 | Data corruption |

### Edge Cases Handled

#### 1. Session Timeout

**Scenario:** User leaves video paused for hours

**Timeline:**
- ▶️ play(0s) ━━━━━► ⏸️ pause(30s)
- ⏸️ pause(30s) ─[3 hours later]─► ▶️ resume(30s)

**Solution:** Only count actual watch time (30-0 = 30s for first segment). Time paused doesn't count as engagement.

#### 2. Out-of-Order Events

**Scenario:** Events arrive out of sequence

**Received:** pause(30s), play(0s), ended(300s), resume(30s)
**Sorted:** play(0s), pause(30s), resume(30s), ended(300s)

**Solution:** Events sorted by timestamp before processing.

#### 3. Duplicate Events

**Scenario:** User double-clicks pause button

**Events:**
- ▶️ play(0s)
- ⏸️ pause(30s)
- ⏸️ pause(30s) [DUPLICATE]

**Solution:** Deduplication logic filters repeated events.

#### 4. Invalid Jumps

**Scenario:** User shows impossible behavior

**Example:** ▶️ resume(100s) ━━━━━► ⏸️ pause(5000s)

currentTime jumped 4900 seconds but only 10 seconds real time passed.

**Solution:** Segment rejected as invalid. Only count if:
- timeDelta < 7200s (max 2 hours per segment)
- timeDelta ≤ timestampDelta + 5s (can't watch faster than real-time)

#### 5. Negative Watch Time

**Scenario:** Events out of logical order

**Example:** ⏸️ pause(100s) appears before ▶️ resume(100s)

Would result in: 100 - 100 = 0s or negative

**Solution:** Validate prevEvent type. Only count if:
- prevEvent = play/resume
- currentEvent = pause/ended

## 🎯 Business Use Cases

### 1. Content Performance Dashboard

**Question:** Which videos perform best?

**Query Approach:**
```sql
SELECT
    videoId,
    videoTitle,
    COUNT(DISTINCT userId) as uniqueViewers,
    AVG(watchPercentage) as avgWatchPct,
    AVG(completionPercentage) as avgCompletionPct,
    SUM(completionCount) as totalCompletions,
    AVG(engagementScore) as avgEngagement
FROM aggregated_user_video_engagement
WHERE dataQualityFlag = 'ok'  -- Exclude problematic data
GROUP BY videoId, videoTitle
ORDER BY avgEngagement DESC
```

**Insights:**
- High avgEngagement + High avgWatchPct = Great video ⭐
- High completionPct + Low watchPct = Users skip to end (might need better content)
- Low both = Poor content or wrong audience

---

### 2. User Segmentation

**Question:** Who are my power users vs casual viewers?

**Segments:**

| Segment | Criteria | Action |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **Power Users** | engagementTier = "High", sessionCount > 3, avgWatchPercentage > 75% | Target for advanced content, beta features |
| **Engaged Learners** | backwardSkipCount > 0 (rewatching), pauseCount > 2 (taking notes), completionCount > 0 | Offer certifications, downloadable resources |
| **Casual Browsers** | sessionCount = 1, watchPercentage < 50%, No completions | Better recommendations, shorter content |
| **At Risk** | avgWatchPercentage < 15%, Multiple videos with "very_short_watch" | Survey for feedback, improve onboarding |

---

### 3. Drop-off Analysis

**Question:** Where do users stop watching?

**Approach:**
```sql
-- Find common drop-off points
SELECT
    videoId,
    FLOOR(maxPositionReached / 30) * 30 as dropOffBucket,
    COUNT(*) as userCount
FROM aggregated_user_video_engagement
WHERE completionCount = 0  -- Users who didn't finish
GROUP BY videoId, dropOffBucket
ORDER BY videoId, dropOffBucket
```

**Visualization Example:**

| Time Range | Drop-off Count | Visualization | Analysis |
|------------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| 0-30s | 120 users | ████████████ | Intro too long? |
| 30-60s | 80 users | ████████ | |
| 60-90s | 40 users | ████ | |
| 90-120s | 20 users | ██ | |
| 240-270s | 170 users | █████████████████ | Problem section! |

**Action:** Improve the 240-270s section (confusing content, technical issue, etc.)

---

### 4. Course Completion Tracking

**Question:** Are users finishing our training series?

**Multi-Video Analysis:**
```sql
-- Users who completed all videos in a course
WITH course_videos AS (
    SELECT videoId FROM videos WHERE courseId = 'COURSE_101'
),
user_completions AS (
    SELECT
        userId,
        COUNT(DISTINCT videoId) as videosCompleted
    FROM aggregated_user_video_engagement
    WHERE
        videoId IN (SELECT videoId FROM course_videos)
        AND isCompletedAtLeastOnce = true
        AND dataQualityFlag = 'ok'
    GROUP BY userId
)
SELECT
    videosCompleted,
    COUNT(userId) as userCount,
    ROUND(COUNT(userId) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(userId)) OVER(), 2) as percentage
FROM user_completions
GROUP BY videosCompleted
ORDER BY videosCompleted DESC
```

---

### 5. Engagement Trends Over Time

**Question:** Is engagement improving?

**Temporal Analysis:**
```sql
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('week', firstWatchDate) as week,
    AVG(watchPercentage) as avgWatchPct,
    AVG(engagementScore) as avgEngagement,
    COUNT(DISTINCT userId) as activeUsers
FROM aggregated_user_video_engagement
WHERE firstWatchDate >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY week
ORDER BY week
```

**Trend Chart:**

| Week | Avg Watch % | Engagement | Active Users | Trend |
|------|-------------|------------|--------------|-------|
| 2024-W01 | 45% | 32.5 | 1,250 | |
| 2024-W02 | 48% | 35.2 | 1,420 | |
| 2024-W03 | 52% | 38.7 | 1,680 | ← Improving! |
| 2024-W04 | 55% | 42.1 | 1,890 | |

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### How the Aggregation Works

#### Step-by-Step Process:

| Step | Process | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Step 1** | Load Raw Events | Filter: Valid events only (play/pause/resume/ended), Non-null userId, videoId, currentTime |
| **Step 2** | Calculate Watch Segments | Sort events by timestamp, Use LAG to get previous event, Calculate timeDelta = currentTime - prevTime, Validate segment (start event + end event) |
| **Step 3** | Calculate Unique Seconds | Merge overlapping intervals, Count unique seconds watched (Optional) |
| **Step 4** | Aggregate by Session | Group by userId + videoId + sessionId, SUM(watchedSeconds) as watchTime, MAX(currentTime) as maxPosition, COUNT pauses, skips, etc. |
| **Step 5** | Aggregate by User+Video | Group by userId + videoId (across all sessions), SUM watchTime from all sessions, COUNT sessions, Calculate averages |
| **Step 6** | Enrich with Metadata | Join video metadata (duration, title), Calculate percentages, Calculate engagement score, Apply data quality flags |
| **Output** | One row per User+Video | Final aggregated result |

### Code Reference

Main processing logic is in databricks_video_aggregation.py:

- **Line 78-139:** `calculate_watch_segments()` - Identifies valid watch segments
- **Line 141-179:** `calculate_unique_seconds_watched()` - Counts unique seconds
- **Line 250-282:** `aggregate_sessions()` - Session-level aggregation
- **Line 284-346:** `aggregate_user_video()` - Final user+video aggregation
- **Line 348-418:** `enrich_with_video_metadata()` - Adds metadata and calculates scores

---

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Test Data Examples

Use databricks_example_notebook.py to generate test data and validate results.

**Key Test Cases:**

| Test Case | Expected Result | Validates |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| Perfect viewing (play → end) | 100% watch, 100% completion | Basic happy path |
| Pause + resume | Correct time excluding pause | Segment calculation |
| Browser close (no end event) | Only counts completed segments | Conservative approach |
| Skip forward | Lower watch %, higher completion % | Jump detection |
| Rewind | Higher watch %, correct unique seconds | Replay handling |
| Multiple sessions | Aggregation across sessions | Session grouping |
| Skip to end | Completion flag, data quality alert | Gaming detection |

### Validation Queries

```sql
-- Test 1: Verify no negative watch time
SELECT * FROM aggregated_user_video_engagement
WHERE totalWatchTime < 0;
-- Expected: 0 rows

-- Test 2: Watch percentage should be reasonable
SELECT * FROM aggregated_user_video_engagement
WHERE watchPercentage > 200;  -- Over 200% is suspicious
-- Expected: Few or no rows

-- Test 3: Completion requires sufficient watch time
SELECT * FROM aggregated_user_video_engagement
WHERE completed = true
  AND watchPercentage < 50
  AND dataQualityFlag = 'ok';
-- Expected: 0 rows (should all be flagged)

-- Test 4: Max position can't exceed video duration
SELECT * FROM aggregated_user_video_engagement
WHERE maxPositionReached > videoDuration;
-- Expected: 0 rows
```

## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Solutions

### Limitation 1: Browser Close Detection

**Problem:** When users close browser without pausing, we lose tracking.

**Example:** User watches for 60s, closes browser.
- We only counted segments up to last event
- Lost tracking of final 60s

**Solutions:**

| Solution | Implementation | Effectiveness |
|----------|----------------|---------------|
| **Heartbeat Events** (Recommended) | Send position update every 30 seconds automatically. Code: `setInterval(() => trackEvent('heartbeat', currentTime), 30000)` | High - captures most data |
| **beforeunload Handler** | `window.addEventListener('beforeunload', () => { trackEvent('video_pause', video.currentTime); });` | Medium - sometimes blocked |
| **Accept Conservative Estimates** | Understand ~10-20% of watch time may be lost. Focus on trends rather than absolute values | Low - data loss accepted |

---

### Limitation 2: Multi-Device Sessions

**Problem:** Same user on multiple devices shows as different sessions.

**Example:** User starts video on phone, continues on laptop.
- Shows as 2 incomplete sessions
- Can't track cross-device journey

**Solution:** Implement user authentication and device fingerprinting.

---

### Limitation 3: Unique Seconds Performance

**Problem:** Calculating unique seconds is memory-intensive for very long videos (>2 hours).

**Impact:** May slow down processing or cause memory issues.

**Solutions:**

| Solution | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| Efficient interval merging | Already implemented in `calculate_unique_seconds_efficient()` |
| Disable for long videos | Disable unique seconds calculation for videos >2 hours |
| Offline calculation | Calculate unique seconds offline as a secondary job |

---

### Limitation 4: Livestream vs VOD

**Problem:** Livestreams have dynamic duration.

**Current Behavior:** System assumes fixed video duration.

**Solution:** For livestreams, use different logic:
- Track "time spent watching" instead of "percentage watched"
- Don't calculate completion percentage
- Add `isLivestream` flag to video metadata

---
