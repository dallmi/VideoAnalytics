# Interval Merging Algorithm Explained

## üéØ The Problem

When users rewind and re-watch parts of a video, we need to calculate **unique seconds watched** without double-counting overlapping time periods.

### Example Scenario

**User watches a 5-minute (300s) video:**
1. Watches from 0s to 30s (watches 30 seconds)
2. Rewinds to 20s
3. Watches from 20s to 50s (watches 30 seconds more)

**Question**: How many unique seconds did they watch?

**Wrong Answer**: 30 + 30 = 60 seconds ‚ùå
- This counts seconds 20-30 twice!

**Correct Answer**: 50 unique seconds ‚úÖ
- They watched 0-50s continuously
- The overlap (20-30s) should only be counted once

---

## üìä Visual Example

### Raw Watch Segments
```
Timeline:  0    10    20    30    40    50    60
           |-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
Segment 1: [===========]                          (0-30s)
Segment 2:             [===========]              (20-50s)

Overlap:               [===]                      (20-30s counted twice!)
```

### After Merging
```
Timeline:  0    10    20    30    40    50    60
           |-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
Merged:    [=========================]            (0-50s)

Result: 50 unique seconds
```

## üîß The Algorithm (Step by Step)

The SQL query in [`databricks_video_aggregation.py:506-572`](databricks_video_aggregation.py#L506-L572) implements this in 4 steps:

### Step 1: Add Previous Segment Info

**Input**: Raw segments sorted by start time
```
| segmentStart | segmentEnd |
|--------------|------------|
| 0            | 30         |
| 20           | 50         |
```

**Process**: Use `LAG()` window function to get previous segment's end
```sql
LAG(segmentEnd) OVER (PARTITION BY userId, videoId, sessionId ORDER BY segmentStart)
```

**Output**:
```
| segmentStart | segmentEnd | prevEnd |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| 0            | 30         | NULL    | ‚Üê First segment (no previous)
| 20           | 50         | 30      | ‚Üê Previous ended at 30
```

---

### Step 2: Detect Overlaps

**Logic**: Does this segment overlap with the previous one?
- **Overlap**: `segmentStart <= prevEnd` (segments touch or overlap)
- **Gap**: `segmentStart > prevEnd` (there's a gap between segments)

**Process**:
```sql
CASE
    WHEN prevEnd IS NULL OR segmentStart > prevEnd THEN 1  -- New group (gap)
    ELSE 0                                                  -- Same group (overlap)
END as newGroup
```

**Output**:
```
| segmentStart | segmentEnd | prevEnd | newGroup | Explanation                    |
|--------------|------------|---------|----------|--------------------------------|
| 0            | 30         | NULL    | 1        | First segment = new group      |
| 20           | 50         | 30      | 0        | 20 <= 30 = overlap = same group|
```

**If there was a gap** (e.g., third segment starting at 60):
```
| segmentStart | segmentEnd | prevEnd | newGroup | Explanation                    |
|--------------|------------|---------|----------|--------------------------------|
| 0            | 30         | NULL    | 1        | First segment                  |
| 20           | 50         | 30      | 0        | Overlaps with previous         |
| 60           | 90         | 50      | 1        | 60 > 50 = gap = new group      |
```

---

### Step 3: Assign Group IDs

**Logic**: Use running sum of `newGroup` to create group identifiers
- All overlapping segments get the same `groupId`

**Process**:
```sql
SUM(newGroup) OVER (PARTITION BY userId, videoId, sessionId ORDER BY segmentStart)
```

**Output**:
```
| segmentStart | segmentEnd | newGroup | groupId | Calculation     |
|--------------|------------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| 0            | 30         | 1        | 1       | 1               |
| 20           | 50         | 0        | 1       | 1 + 0 = 1       |
```

**With gap example**:
```
| segmentStart | segmentEnd | newGroup | groupId | Calculation     |
|--------------|------------|----------|---------|-----------------|
| 0            | 30         | 1        | 1       | 1               |
| 20           | 50         | 0        | 1       | 1 + 0 = 1       |
| 60           | 90         | 1        | 2       | 1 + 0 + 1 = 2   |
```

---

### Step 4: Merge by Group

**Logic**: For each group, take the earliest start and latest end
- `MIN(segmentStart)` = when the merged interval starts
- `MAX(segmentEnd)` = when the merged interval ends

**Process**:
```sql
SELECT
    userId, videoId, sessionId,
    MIN(segmentStart) as mergedStart,
    MAX(segmentEnd) as mergedEnd
FROM grouped
GROUP BY userId, videoId, sessionId, groupId
```

**Output**:
```
| groupId | mergedStart | mergedEnd | Length | Explanation              |
|---------|-------------|-----------|--------|--------------------------|
| 1       | 0           | 50        | 50s    | Merged [0-30] + [20-50]  |
```

**With gap example**:
```
| groupId | mergedStart | mergedEnd | Length | Explanation              |
|---------|-------------|-----------|--------|--------------------------|
| 1       | 0           | 50        | 50s    | Merged [0-30] + [20-50]  |
| 2       | 60          | 90        | 30s    | Standalone segment       |

Total unique seconds: 50 + 30 = 80 seconds
```

## üéì Complete Example Walkthrough

### Scenario: Peter Watches Video 1

**Raw watch segments** (from events):
```
Segment 1: 0s ‚Üí 30s   (watched 30 seconds)
Segment 2: 30s ‚Üí 120s (watched 90 seconds)
Segment 3: 110s ‚Üí 120s (rewound, watched 10 seconds)
```

### Step-by-Step Processing

**After Step 1** (add prevEnd):
```
| segmentStart | segmentEnd | prevEnd |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| 0            | 30         | NULL    |
| 30           | 120        | 30      |
| 110          | 120        | 120     |
```

**After Step 2** (detect overlaps):
```
| segmentStart | segmentEnd | prevEnd | newGroup | Why?                |
|--------------|------------|---------|----------|---------------------|
| 0            | 30         | NULL    | 1        | First segment       |
| 30           | 120        | 30      | 0        | 30 <= 30 (touches)  |
| 110          | 120        | 120     | 0        | 110 <= 120 (overlap)|
```

**After Step 3** (assign groups):
```
| segmentStart | segmentEnd | newGroup | groupId |
|--------------|------------|----------|---------|
| 0            | 30         | 1        | 1       |
| 30           | 120        | 0        | 1       |
| 110          | 120        | 0        | 1       |
```

**After Step 4** (merge):
```
| groupId | mergedStart | mergedEnd | Unique Seconds |
|---------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| 1       | 0           | 120       | 120            |
```

**Result**: Peter watched **120 unique seconds** (0-120s range)
- Even though he rewound and re-watched 110-120s
- Total watch time: 30 + 90 + 10 = 130s
- Unique seconds: 120s (no double-counting)

## üí° Why This Algorithm Works

### Key Insight
By sorting segments by start time and checking if each segment overlaps with the previous one, we can identify **groups of overlapping segments**.

### The Magic of Running Sum
```
newGroup values: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
Running sum:     [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
                  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
                  Group 1  Group 2
```

The running sum creates a unique ID for each group of overlapping segments!

### Efficiency
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) for sorting + O(n) for merging = O(n log n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for intermediate results
- **Scalability**: Works efficiently in Spark with millions of segments

### Alternative Approaches
- **Explode method**: Expand each segment to individual seconds, then deduplicate
  - Pros: Easier to understand
  - Cons: Very memory-intensive for long videos (300s video = 300 rows per segment!)
- **Interval tree**: More complex data structure
  - Pros: Faster for dynamic updates
  - Cons: Overkill for batch processing, harder to implement in SQL
