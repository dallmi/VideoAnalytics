## Timeline Assumptions

### What's Included in 4 Weeks

✅ Code adaptation to company infrastructure
✅ Full testing (P0, P1, sample P2)
✅ Dashboard creation (basic + advanced views)
✅ Production deployment
✅ Monitoring setup
✅ User training
✅ Documentation
✅ Knowledge transfer

### What's NOT Included

❌ Major architectural changes
❌ Custom features beyond core requirements
❌ Integration with other systems (beyond BI tools)
❌ Real-time streaming (batch only)
❌ Advanced ML/predictive analytics

### Assumptions

1. **Code baseline is solid** - The provided solution works as-is
2. **Data structure similar** - Raw events have required fields (userId, videoId, timestamp, eventName, currentTime)
3. **Team availability** - All team members at least 80% dedicated
4. **Infrastructure ready** - Databricks environment accessible
5. **Stakeholder availability** - Available for reviews and sign-offs
6. **No major blockers** - Permissions, approvals move quickly

---

## Optimization Opportunities

If timeline needs to compress to **3 weeks:**

**Cut these low-priority items:**
- ⬇️ P2 edge case testing (save 1 day)
- ⬇️ Advanced dashboard features (save 1 day)
- ⬇️ Week 4 monitoring period (reduce to 3 days, save 2 days)
- ⬇️ Formal training sessions (async documentation instead, save 1 day)

**Total savings: 5 days → 3 weeks possible** ⚠️ Higher risk

---

## Post-Implementation (Optional Phase 2)

After 4-week initial implementation, consider:

**Future Enhancements (Backlog):**
- Real-time streaming aggregation (Structured Streaming)
- Predictive analytics (completion probability)
- A/B testing framework
- Advanced segmentation (cohort analysis)
- Mobile vs Desktop tracking
- Video quality tracking
- Automated anomaly detection

**Timeline for Phase 2:** 2-4 weeks (depending on scope)

---

## Communication Plan

### Daily
- 15-min standup (blockers, progress, plan)
- Slack updates on critical issues

### Weekly
- Sprint review (Friday, 1h)
- Sprint planning (Monday, 1h for Sprint 2)
- Demo to stakeholders (Friday, 30 min)

### Bi-weekly
- Sprint retrospective (Friday, 1.5h)

### Milestone-based
- Go/No-Go decision after Week 2
- Production go-live approval after Week 3
- Final sign-off after Week 4
