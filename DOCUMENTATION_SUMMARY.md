2. [`databricks_video_aggregation.py`](03_DEVELOPMENT/databricks_video_aggregation.py) (lines 1-128) - Overall system design

**Then explore**:
- Method-level documentation for the specific function you're refactoring
- Related test scenarios in `test_data_generator_complete.py`

**Key sections**:
- Line 296-435: Watch segment calculation algorithm (most complex logic)

- Line 348-418: Data quality handling

### For QA/Testers (Validating Functionality)

**Read first**:
1. [`test_data_generator_complete.py`](04_TESTING/test_data_generator_complete.py) (lines 1-69) - Test scenario summary
2. [`databricks_example_notebook.py`](03_DEVELOPMENT/databricks_example_notebook.py) - Tutorial with examples

**Then execute**:
1. Run `test_data_generator_complete.py` to generate test data
2. Run `databricks_video_aggregation.py` to aggregate
3. Validate results against expected outcomes in test documentation

**Key sections**:
- Lines 12-43: Table of all 25 test scenarios with expected behavior
- Each TC-XXX section shows exact inputs and expected outputs

### For Business Analysts (Understanding Metrics)

**Read first**:

2. [`databricks_example_notebook.py`](03_DEVELOPMENT/databricks_example_notebook.py) - Example queries

**Key concepts**:
- **totalWatchTime**: Sum of all watch segments (includes rewatched content)
- **uniqueSecondsWatched**: Unique video content seen (no double-counting)
- **watchPercentage**: (totalWatchTime / videoDuration) × 100
- **completionPercentage**: (maxPositionReached / videoDuration) × 100
- **engagementScore**: Composite metric combining watch time, completions, and sessions
- **engagementTier**: High/Medium/Low/Minimal based on engagement score

## 💡 Key Documentation Highlights

### 1. **Peter's Example** (Most Referenced)
Located in multiple files, shows:
- Raw events: 6 events with timestamps and positions
- Watch segments: 3 segments totaling 130 seconds
- Unique seconds: 120 seconds (0-120 range)
- Calculations: watchPercentage = 130/300 = 43.3%
- Interpretation: User watched 43.3% with one rewind

### 2. **Data Quality Flags**
Documented in lines 410-417 of main script:
- `excessive_watch_time`: watchTime > duration × 1.2
- `very_short_watch`: watchTime < 5 seconds
- `completed_without_sufficient_watch`: Completion flagged but watch% < 75%
- `ok`: No issues detected

### 3. **Engagement Score Formula**
Documented in lines 388-407:
```
engagementScore = (watchTime/60) × 1.0
                  + completions × 50
                  + sessions × 5
                  - skips × 2
```

Tiers:
- **High**: score > 100
- **Medium**: score > 50
- **Low**: score > 10
- **Minimal**: score ≤ 10
